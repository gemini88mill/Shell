# .junie directory

This directory is used by Junie (JetBrains autonomous programmer) for project-related metadata and automation artifacts.

It is intentionally kept under version control so that collaborators and tools can discover or store Junie-specific configuration in a consistent location.

If you add any configuration files here, ensure they do not contain secrets.
